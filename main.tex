        \subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
            First, we create a repository in github in such a way 
            that we enter the desired name in its creation and tick
             the box to create a README file. Then, with the 'git clone
              <ssh>' command, we transfer the above repository to our 
              system. Then create a file called main.md to write the 
              answers to the questions and use the command 'git add.'  
              Take it to stage mode and commit the file with the command
               'git commit -m "add main.md" and then apply the changes to 
               github with the command 'git push origin master'. Now the 
               project is ready for the next stage...
